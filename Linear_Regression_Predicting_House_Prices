# Linear regression model using scikit-learn that predicts house prices in San Francisco with the given features:
# Size (square footage, numeric)
# Location (categorical, e.g., neighborhood)
# Number of bedrooms (numeric)
# Age of house (numeric)
# Amenities (categorical, e.g., pool, garage, etc.)
# Condition (categorical or ordinal: poor, fair, good, excellent)

# Additional notes:
# ColumnTransformer ensures numeric features are standardized (StandardScaler) and categorical ones are one-hot encoded (OneHotEncoder)
# Pipeline keeps preprocessing and regression together, so you can easily train and predict without repeating transformations
# The dataset here is tiny and just for illustration—you’d normally use a much larger dataset (e.g., from Zillow, Redfin, or public city records)
