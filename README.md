# ML Class for Everyone

## A Gentle Introduction to Machine Learning for Everyone
The goal of this class is to learn the fundamentals of ML technologies

There are six classes. Class 7 is a final project where students present a machine learning application.

Each class includes a presentation, readings, videos to watch, and homework.

The most difficult concepts are presented and discussed in multiple classes in an incremental way.

There is some easy homework to do from Class 1 to Class 3. Students are expected to work from Class 4 to Class 6 on their final projects.
