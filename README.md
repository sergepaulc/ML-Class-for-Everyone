# ML Class for Everyone

## A Gentle Introduction to Machine Learning for Everyone
The goal of this class is to learn the fundamentals of ML technologies. There are six classes. Class 7 is a final project where students present a machine learning application. Each class includes a presentation, readings, videos to watch, and homework. The most difficult concepts are presented and discussed in multiple classes in an incremental way. There is some easy homework to do from Class 1 to Class 3. Students are expected to work from Class 4 to Class 6 on their final projects.

Homework:

- You have been hired to be the first Product Manager, Program Manager, or Designer for a new online store. Your first assignment is to lead the development of an ML application for classifying the products across various categories that will be available on the store. Consider that the store will provide up to 500 products from many suppliers across many types of categories for consumers such as home decoration, cooking, fashion, fitness‚Ä¶To get started on that assignment, please propose a small draft of your proposed plan for that app. Please put your thoughts in the same google document that you use for your previous homework.
- Since you completed ahead of schedule and with a lower budget your classification app, you are now being asked to develop a segmentation app for the customers that will be visiting and purchasing on the store. That app could leverage the labels of your classification apps. Please put your thoughts in the same google document that you use for your previous homework.

Note: You can be as creative as you want in terms of the product plan that you will use to drive the development of those apps but at least describe the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of the apps, the data sources/features, the possible models, and any KPIs. If you are running out of time, just do something simple in a few sentences for each homework in ¬Ω page. If you have time, do as much as you can üôÇ
