# ML Class for Everyone

## A Gentle Introduction to Machine Learning for Everyone
The goal of this class is to learn the fundamentals of ML technologies.

There are six classes. Class 7 is a final project where students present a machine learning application.

Each class includes a presentation, readings, videos to watch, and homework.

The most difficult concepts are presented and discussed in multiple classes in an incremental way.

There is some easy homework to do from Class 1 to Class 3. Students are expected to work from Class 4 to Class 6 on their final projects.

Homework:

Select a few ML applications that you are using every day on your desktop or your mobile phone. Classify them into supervised or unsupervised learning. Try to identify the source of the data. Try to evaluate the experience of the application. 
Propose a few applications that could be developed using an estimation (based on a regression), a classification (based on a logistic regression), and a segmentation (based on a K-means clustering).
